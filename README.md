Documentation for a Hotel Management System project developed using Java and SQL.
# Hotel Management System

## Project Overview
This repository serves as documentation for a **Hotel Management System** developed. The project aimed to streamline core hotel operations, including guest management, room booking, and billing. While the full source code is not available, this documentation details the system's functionalities, technologies used, and my specific contributions.

## Features & Functionalities
The system included, but was not limited to, the following key features:
* **Guest Management:** Functionality to add, view, update, and search guest details.
* **Room Booking:** Ability to check room availability, book rooms for guests, and manage check-in/check-out processes.
* **Billing & Invoicing:** Generation of bills for guests, including room charges and additional services.
* **Reporting:** Basic reports on occupancy and revenue.
* **User Authentication:** Secure login for different user roles (e.g., receptionist, manager).

## Technologies Used
* **Java:** Used for developing the backend logic and user interface (if it was a desktop app like Swing/AWT).
* **SQL:** Used for database management and interaction.
* **[Specific Database, e.g., MySQL / PostgreSQL]:** (If you remember which specific SQL database you used, add it here).

## My Role & Contributions
As a key contributor to the project:
* **Database Management:** Assisted in designing the database schema and implementing complex **SQL queries** for managing guest data, room status, booking details, and transactions.
* **System Testing:** Conducted thorough **testing procedures** to ensure the reliability and data integrity of the system, particularly focusing on database operations and user workflows.
* **Collaboration:** Actively collaborated with the team on debugging and refining various modules to ensure smooth operation.

## System Architecture (High-Level Description)
* **Frontend (Client-Side):** This would be the part of the system that users (hotel staff, receptionists) directly interact with. Developed using Java Swing or JavaFX (common Java GUI frameworks), creating a graphical user interface (GUI) that runs on a desktop computer. This GUI would have forms for guest check-in, check-out, room booking, viewing guest details, generating bills, etc.

* **Backend Logic (Application Layer):** Written in Java, this layer contains the core business logic of the hotel management system. It processes user requests from the frontend, such as "book a room," "check available rooms," or "generate bill." It interacts with the database to store, retrieve, update, or delete information.
* **Database (Data Layer):** This is where all the hotel data is stored. Managed by an SQL database management system (DBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite. It would contain tables for Guests, Rooms, Bookings, Payments, Staff, etc. Your role in using SQL would involve writing queries to interact with this database (e.g., INSERT new guests, SELECT available rooms, UPDATE booking statuses, DELETE old records).

## Learnings & Challenges
* Gained practical experience in integrating Java applications with relational databases using SQL.
* Learned the importance of robust database design and efficient query writing for performance.
* Understood the process of systematic software testing and bug reporting in a team environment.
* *(Optional: Mention a specific challenge, e.g., "Managed complex SQL joins for generating accurate billing reports.")*
