Documentation for a Hotel Management System project developed using Java and SQL.
# Hotel Management System

## Project Overview
This repository serves as documentation for a **Hotel Management System** developed. The project aimed to streamline core hotel operations, including guest management, room booking, and billing. While the full source code is not publicly available (as the project was deleted after showcasing), this documentation details the system's functionalities, technologies used, and my specific contributions.

## Features & Functionalities
The system included, but was not limited to, the following key features:
* **Guest Management:** Functionality to add, view, update, and search guest details.
* **Room Booking:** Ability to check room availability, book rooms for guests, and manage check-in/check-out processes.
* **Billing & Invoicing:** Generation of bills for guests, including room charges and additional services.
* **Reporting:** Basic reports on occupancy and revenue.
* **User Authentication:** Secure login for different user roles (e.g., receptionist, manager).

## Technologies Used
* **Java:** Used for developing the backend logic and user interface (if it was a desktop app like Swing/AWT).
* **SQL:** Used for database management and interaction.
* **[Specific Database, e.g., MySQL / PostgreSQL]:** (If you remember which specific SQL database you used, add it here).

## My Role & Contributions
As a key contributor to the project:
* **Database Management:** Assisted in designing the database schema and implementing complex **SQL queries** for managing guest data, room status, booking details, and transactions.
* **System Testing:** Conducted thorough **testing procedures** to ensure the reliability and data integrity of the system, particularly focusing on database operations and user workflows.
* **Collaboration:** Actively collaborated with the team on debugging and refining various modules to ensure smooth operation.

## System Architecture (High-Level Description)
*(Briefly describe how the parts connected. E.g., "The system followed a client-server architecture, where the Java application interacted with a central relational database via JDBC for data persistence.")*

## Learnings & Challenges
* Gained practical experience in integrating Java applications with relational databases using SQL.
* Learned the importance of robust database design and efficient query writing for performance.
* Understood the process of systematic software testing and bug reporting in a team environment.
* *(Optional: Mention a specific challenge, e.g., "Managed complex SQL joins for generating accurate billing reports.")*

## Screenshots / Mockups (CRUCIAL - Add if you have ANY!)
*(If you have any old screenshots from presentations, design mockups, or even photos from the showcasing, include them here. Even a basic image makes a huge difference.)*
